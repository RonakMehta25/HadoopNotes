Hbase 


HBase is an open source, multidimensional, distributed, scalable and a NoSQL database written in Java. HBase runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and provides BigTable (Google) like capabilities to Hadoop. It is designed to provide a fault-tolerant way of storing the large collection of sparse data sets. HBase achieves high throughput and low latency by providing faster Read/Write Access on huge datasets.
